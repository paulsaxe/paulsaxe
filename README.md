### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am the Lead Software Scientist at the Molecular Sceicnes Software Institute ([MolSSI](https://molssi.org/)) at [Virginia Tech](https://www.vt.edu/). Currently I am leading the [SEAMM](https://github.com/molssi-seamm) project, which is an open-source environment for computaional chemistry and materials science. If this is your area, try it out! And do let me know how it goes. The documentation has several ways to provide feedback, or you can always reach me at psaxe@vt.edu.
